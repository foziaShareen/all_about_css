1. Make both paragraph elements wrap around the image.
2. Use Float to move the cat div to the left and the dog div to the right.
3. Use clear to make the footer go below both the cat and dog div. -->

  <!-- note: why we need Float
  suppose we have an image of car and a paragraph 
  they will disply stack wise but we want image side of the paragraph so we can float image to left or right 
  why we use clear
  suppose we have an image a para and footer , if we use float to the image para will wrap around the image and 
  because footer is just under the para it will not put in bottom which we want so we use clear
  to clear the float -->
